# The Game
Quarto is traditionally a board game played by 2 players. The game is played on a 4 x 4 board with 16 unique playing pieces. Each piece is a combination of the following qualities: tall or short; light or dark; square or circular; and hollow-top or solid-top. 

The game is played by taking turns placing a piece given to you by your opponent and then choosing a piece for your opponent to place. Play continues until there are 4 pieces in a row with at least one similar quality, or the board is filled.
