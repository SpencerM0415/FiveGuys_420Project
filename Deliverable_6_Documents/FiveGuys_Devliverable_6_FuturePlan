  Plan for Future:
    We plan on trying to roll out updates on a biweekly basis that add these features. We hope to release a patch around thursday every other week.
The reason for this method of releaseing updates is to help insure we have the time needed to fully implement and perfect these functions. We will
first start with the more important feature like matchmaking, as well as the gamesmodes. We find that these are more immperative to the application
functionality then other things such as a shop with skins or different language options. We must first prioritize the applications basic functionality 
before we implement quality of life updates.
