Script:

After seeing the the product video and product mock up I'd like you to answer a couple questions and ask any questions you may have.

Q1. What do you like about the app from what you have seen and heard today?

A: The scope of the app is good in that it fulfills its objectives in providing a simple, easy to play game app. It is easy to play and 
offers varied gameplay.

Q2. What do you not like about the app?

A: lackluster visuals, lack of intuitive visual queues for players to know what to do when.

Q3. What would you like to see from our product in the future?

A:Extensions of board size, composition, such as a 5x5 board, or board with certain squares greyed out so players cannot place there.

Q4. What would you change about the product?

A: Add more life to the game, such as a narrative or storytelling aspect. Give the player a reason to care about the competition other
than simply beating the opponent's pieces

Q5. How long do you think you'd use our product?

A: Probably about 45 minutes over the course of 4-5 days.

Q6. Are there any questions about our product that you have that we havent touched upon today?
    Yes: Is there a way to connect with social media to post interesting gameplay styles or scores et cetera?
    
    Answer: Although that is not part of the app plans at the moment, it is a great suggestion, one that we hope to adress in a future
            release.
