Interview with Anna Dyer, prospective user.

After seeing the the product video and product mock up I'd like you to answer a couple questions and ask any questions you may have.

Q1. What do you like about the app from what you have seen and heard today?
    I like that you were disability concious, a lot of games do not have those options available. I definitely don't see these options anywhere on games I play.
    I like the idea of the board game.
    I like the online competitive matchmaking, I feel like that's awesome because when I play games online its hard to find players that are fun to play with.
    
Q2. What do you not like about the app?
    I'm worried about the shop, because I don't like when real money comes into games. But I also don't want ads, so it seems like a necessary evil.

Q3. What would you like to see from our product in the future?
    I would like to see move analysis and strategy recommendations. 

Q4. What would you change about the product?
    I think the design needs a better color scheme, it seems a little too busy.

Q5. How long do you think youd use our product?
    20-30 minutes a day, and I would play it on and off for maybe a couple years.

Q6. Are there any questions about our product that you have that we havent touched upon today?
    Nothing comes to mind.
