Interview with Brett MacMillan, prospective user.

After seeing the the product video and product mock up I'd like you to answer a couple questions and ask any questions you may have.

Q1. What do you like about the app from what you have seen and heard today?
	It seems like a fun and simple game. The app looks very nice and I like that you can change the colors of the pieces to better suit your likings. 

Q2. What do you not like about the app?
	I don't like that there are ads that you have to pay to remove. They can be very annoying and cause people to lose intrest in games.

Q3. What would you like to see from our product in the future?
	I would like to see more visuals telling you whose turn it is and things of that nature.

Q4. What would you change about the product?
	I would just make it a little more athestically apealling. Making menu screens and board layout look nice and clean. 

Q5. How long do you think youd use our product?
	I could see myself playing for like 30 minutes a day or so when I'm bored.

Q6. Are there any questions about our product that you have that we havent touched upon today?
	Not that I can think of.

I am allowing recording of myself and my answers to any questions in this focus group.
