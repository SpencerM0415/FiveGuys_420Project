After seeing the the product video and product mock up I'd like you to answer a couple questions and ask any questions you may have.

Q1. What do you like about the app from what you have seen and heard today?
The game looks like fun and would be challenging to master. 

Q2. What do you not like about the app?
The UI is a bit rough right now, maybe a little more artwork

Q3. What would you like to see from our product in the future?
I'd like to see it in the app store someday!

Q4. What would you change about the product?
I would make a 3D version at some point

Q5. How long do you think you'd use our product?
I'd use it daily as a time passing game

Q6. Are there any questions about our product that you have that we havent touched upon today?
Q: Why did you choose the game Quarto?

My response: We chose Quarto because it is a game that not our whole team had experience in, so learning a game alongside development would be interesting.
